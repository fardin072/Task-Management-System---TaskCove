# TaskCove - Task Management Web Application

TaskCove is a simple yet powerful task management web application that allows users to add, update, remove, and mark tasks as done. It uses the browser's localStorage to persist tasks, making the application work even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with titles, descriptions, priorities, and due dates.
- **Update Tasks**: Edit existing tasks by updating their titles and descriptions.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Done**: Toggle the task status between "Done" and "Not Done".
- **Filter and Search**: Filter tasks based on priority and status. Search tasks by title or description.
- **Sort Tasks**: Sort tasks by priority or due date.
- **Persistent Storage**: Task data is saved in `localStorage`, meaning tasks persist even after page reloads.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage**: localStorage for task persistence
- **No Backend**: The application is completely frontend-based with no need for server-side processing.

## Error Handling

TaskCove includes basic error handling:
- If thereâ€™s an issue with `localStorage` (e.g., data corruption), the app will log the error and alert the user.
- If the user tries to add a task without a title or description, the app will alert them to provide both fields.
- If a task with the same title already exists, it will show a message to prevent duplication.
